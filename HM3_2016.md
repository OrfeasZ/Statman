# Hitman Blood Money (2016 Mode)

## Description

In Hitman 2016 mode (toggled by right clicking the statman logo and selecting `Hitman 2016 Mode` while the game is running), the following changes are made:

1. Leaving your suit in the level no longer negatively affects your Silent Assassin rating.
2. When starting a level, instead of spawning at the regular level entry point, you'll instead spawn at a random pre-determined starting location with a given disguise.

The mode is currently very limited, with only one starting location and disguise supported in the Curtains Down mission. In the future, more locations will be added, alongside the option to choose which one to start from (instead of being random).

## Adding more locations

### Enabling the debug mode

To add a new location, make sure you first enable the `Hitman 2016 Mode Debug` and `In-game Overlay` options by right clicking the Statman logo while the game is running. Then, load into a mission of your choice. It might also be a good idea to enable cheats and make NPCs not react to you, to make this process easier.

With these enabled, some additional information will be rendered on your screen, such as the current position of your character, and the IDs of NPCs you can disguise into, similar to the image below:

The first line at the top corner of the screen represents the coordinates of your character. In this case `(-1.00, 0.00, 0.06) (0.00, 1.00, 0.00) (0.06, 0.00, 1.00) (-186.08, -1136.59, 96.62)`.

You can also see the IDs of the different NPCs rendered on them. For example, the police officer to the right of your character has an ID of `53`.

After finding a location and an NPC of your choice, write this information down, as you'll need it in the next step.

### Writing location data

Now that you have the coordinates of your new starting location, and the NPC whose disguise you want to spawn with, open the `HM3_locations.json` file that can be found in your Statman directory with your favorite text editor. Next, you'll need to add a new starting location object inside the object for the level you're currently in (see [below](#levels) for a list of level names). Each location object is associated with a key that must have a unique name. This location object must then contain a `position` and an `outfit` property that have the spawn coordinates and NPC ID whose outfit we want to have.

Using the example above, we'll add a new starting location to Curtains Down (`m03_main`) called `policeman_stage_entrance`, right after the already existing `actor_backstage` location.

```javascript

{
	// ...
	"m03_main": {
	    "actor_backstage": { /* ... */ },
		"policeman_stage_entrance": {
			"position": [[-1.00, 0.00, 0.06], [0.00, 1.00, 0.00], [0.06, 0.00, 1.00], [-186.08, -1136.59, 96.62]],
			"outfit": 53
		}
	},
	// ...
}
```

You'll notice a difference between how we've written the coordinates here compared to how they appeared in-game. You'll need to make sure they are written in the correct format, by replacing `(` with `[`, `)` with `]`, adding commas between each group of 3 numbers, and then surrounding all groups with `[` `]`.

If you want to only change the starting location without changing the outfit, you can set `outfit` to `-1`.

Now save this file, right click the Statman logo, and select `Reload locations`. Next time you load Curtains Down, one of the locations you've written in the file will be randomly chosen to spawn at.
