### Introduction

Statman is a configuration-free and easy-to-use live statistics tracking program for games.

It has been built from the ground up to allow for easy tracking integration of different games and engines, while abstracting the underlying complexity from the end-user. Additionally, Statman features two themes (a light one and a dark one), switcheable by double-clicking the Statman logo, and update-checking features to ensure that your version is always up-to-date.

Statman is currently in early stages of development, so there could still be issues and bugs. If you encounter any issues please feel free to report them on the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/OrfeasZ/Statman/issues).
